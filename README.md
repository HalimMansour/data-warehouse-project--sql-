# 📦 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**! 🚀  
This repository showcases a complete end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution—from ingesting raw data to creating meaningful insights.  
Designed as a professional portfolio project, it demonstrates modern best practices in **data engineering, data architecture, data modeling, and analytics**.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Data
- Stores unmodified data directly from source systems.
- CSV files are imported into **SQL Server** exactly as received.

### 🥈 Silver Layer — Refined Data
- Applies cleaning, standardization, and validation.
- Prepares consistent, reliable datasets for modeling and analysis.

### 🥇 Gold Layer — Business Layer
- Contains curated, business-ready tables modeled using a **star schema**.
- Supports reporting, dashboards, and analytical workloads.
